Just Kudos. I ended with whole Project in Power BI . Sharing you the Bird eye view.
Completing an end-to-end project in Power BI involves several steps, from data preparation and modeling to creating visualizations and sharing insights. Here's a step-by-step guide to how you can accomplish an end-to-end project in Power BI:

****Data Gathering and Preparation:**

Identify the data sources you need for your project. This could include Excel files, databases, web services, or other sources.
Connect to the data sources in Power BI using the appropriate connectors.
Clean and transform the data as needed. This may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data reshaping using Power Query Editor.
**Data Modeling:**

Design a data model that represents the relationships between different tables in your dataset.
Create relationships between tables to enable seamless data navigation and analysis.
Define measures and calculated columns to add business logic and perform calculations.
**Data Visualization:**

Select the appropriate visualizations (charts, tables, maps, etc.) to represent the data and insights effectively.
Design a visually appealing and informative report layout.
Create interactive visuals using slicers, filters, and drill-through functionalities.
Data Analysis:

**Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressio**ns) to create custom calculations and measures to derive insights and KPIs.
Apply statistical functions and aggregations to gain deeper insights from the data.
Dashboard Creation:

**Combine individual visualizations into a cohesive dashboard or report.**
Organize the visuals to tell a compelling data-driven story.
Power BI Desktop Publishing:

**Optimize the report layout and format for better readability.**
Ensure that the report design is responsive and works well on various devices.
Report Interactivity:

**Implement interactive features like bookmarks, drill-through actions, and tooltips to enhance user experience.
Data Refresh and Publishing:**

**Schedule data refresh to keep the report up-to-date with the latest data.**
Publish the report to Power BI service for sharing and collaboration.
Power BI Service:

**Share the published report with relevant stakeholders** or embed it in websites or applications.
Set up appropriate security and access controls for sharing the report.
Collaboration and Distribution:

**Monitor the usage and performance of the report in Power BI service.**
Continuously update the report as new data becomes available or business requirements change.
By following these steps, you can successfully complete an end-to-end project in Power BI, enabling data-driven decision-making and empowering users with valuable insights.
